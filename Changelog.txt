--------
* Fixed issue with object in edit mode not being exported.
* write_igmesh() now always writes at least one UV (to stop Indigo from complaining about meshes without UVs using textures).
* Added Absorption channel to coating material.
* Exposure is now a float value to allow exposure > 1s (unfortunately resets exposure back to 125 in exising scenes).
